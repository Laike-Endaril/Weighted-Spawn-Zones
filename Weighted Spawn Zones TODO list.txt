Allow spawn definitions with empty entities (effectively lets you give a chance of not spawning anything if you add it to a pool)

SAVED ENTITIES
A list of saved entities which can be used in spawn zones
You can edit the name and description of each one (both shown in tooltip)

When any part of any zone in a definition is loaded, that definition queues possible spawn points and entities, up to its limits
Queued spawns are not actually attempted until their block positions are loaded (check on chunk load)
When an attempt fails, the entity is kept and the position is recalculated up to "sameEntityAttempts" times
